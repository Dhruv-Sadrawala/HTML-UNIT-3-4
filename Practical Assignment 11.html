<p>Audi AG Aktiengesellschaft, commonly referred to as <i id="striked">Audi</i>, is a German automotive manufacturer <br> of luxury vehicles headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. As a subsidiary of its parent company,<br> the Volkswagen Group, <i id="striked">Audi</i> produces vehicles in nine production facilities worldwide.</p>

<p>The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the<br> initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch (1868â€“1951); and two other<br> manufacturers(DKW and Wanderer), leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern Audi era began in the<br>1960s, when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.[9] After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus<br>creating the present-day form of <i id="striked">Audi</i></p>
